🕵️‍♀️ SQL Murder Mystery – Who Killed the CEO?

A data-driven detective case solved entirely using SQL.

This capstone project was done as part of the 21-Day SQL Challenge by Indian Data Club, where the goal was simple but exciting:

👉 Use SQL to solve the murder of the CEO of TechNova Inc.

📘 Project Story

On October 15, 2025 at 9:00 PM, the CEO of TechNova Inc. was found dead inside the CEO Office.

As the data analyst investigating the case, I used:

Keycard logs

Call records

Alibi statements

Physical evidence

…to identify who committed the crime, when, where, and how.

This project tests full SQL capability including:

Joins

Subqueries

Time filtering

Aggregations

Logical deduction

Multi-table analysis

🗂 Database Schema

The case consists of 5 main tables:

Table	Description
employees	Employee details (name, role, department)
keycard_logs	Room entry/exit logs
calls	Phone calls between employees
alibis	Claimed locations & timestamps
evidence	Physical evidence found
🔍 Investigation Summary — How I Solved the Case
1️⃣ Keycard Logs — The First Break

David Kumar entered the CEO’s office at 20:50 and left at 21:00 — exactly overlapping the murder window (~9 PM).

2️⃣ Alibi Check — A Clear Lie

David claimed he was in the Server Room at 20:50.
But the keycard logs proved the opposite.

3️⃣ Suspicious Call

A 45-second call was placed by David to the CEO at 20:55 — directly inside the incident window.

4️⃣ Physical Evidence

Evidence found in the CEO Office:

Fingerprint on desk (21:05)

Keycard swipe mismatch (21:10)

This supported the hypothesis that the killer tampered with access logs.

🧠 Final Conclusion

After combining presence, false alibi, call history, and physical evidence…

🟦 KILLER IDENTIFIED:
👉 David Kumar
